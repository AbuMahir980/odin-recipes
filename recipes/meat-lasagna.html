        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a 9x13-inch glass baking dish with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Combine ricotta cheese, 2 tablespoons water, parsley, and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper in a small bowl; set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add beef and onion; sprinkle with remaining 1/4 teaspoon black pepper, Italian seasoning, and salt. Cook 7 minutes or until beef is crumbled and no longer pink, stirring occasionally. Add garlic; cook 1 minute more or until fragrant. Drain.</li>

        <li>Assemble lasagna by spreading about 1 cup meat sauce over bottom of the baking dish. Place 3 dry noodles over sauce. Top with 2 cups meat sauce, half of the ricotta mixture, 1 cup mozzarella cheese, and 1/3 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, ending with a layer of noodles. Top with remaining meat sauce and remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses.</li>
